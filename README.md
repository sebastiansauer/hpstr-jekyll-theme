# Sebastian Sauer's stats blog 

A blog on research methods with a focus on computational methods using R



I blog about statistics including research methods, particularly for psychology, and particularly with regard to data analysis using R.

As a non-virtual person, I work as a professor at [FOM University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fom.de/die-fom-englisch/the-university-for-the-professionals.html). 

Posts reflect mostly my current thinking; and posts are not immune to thought updates. With luck things and thinking get less wrong in the course of time (I am speaking of myself).
